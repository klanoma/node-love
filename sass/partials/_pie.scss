// this file demonstrates how to use the CSS PIE extension for
// legacy versions of Internet Explorer. In many cases, PIE will allow
// you to style in CSS things that you'd have to do using image chops otherwise.
//
// Note: Each element that has PIE enabled on it will add about 10ms to your page load.
@import "compass/css3/pie";
@import "compass/css3";

// Set this to wherever you end up putting your behavior file.
//
// **Note:** this file must be served as a root-relative resource or
// else IE will interpret it as relative to the current webpage
// instead of the stylesheet.
//
// **Also Note:** this file must be delivered with a mime-type of:
//
//    text/x-component
$pie-behavior: url("/styles/PIE.htc");

// It is suggested that you use Sass's @extend directive to apply the PIE
// behavior to your elements. Setting this variable will tell the `pie` mixin
// to extend it. Or you can just extend the base class yourself.
$pie-base-class: pie-element;

// There are two approaches to creating PIE elements
// The default approach is to make the element position: relative.
.pie-element {
  // relative is the default, so passing relative
  // is redundant, but we do it here for clarity.
  @include pie-element(relative);
